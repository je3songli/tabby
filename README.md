The inspiration behind Tabby came from the observation of rampant overconsumption during holidays, leading to financial strain and environmental impact. We wanted to create a tool that promotes mindful spending and sustainable choices. The name Tabby comes from the species of cat, which we decided suits our product because of the giving nature of outdoor tabby cats to their owners - hence, putting an emphasis on community.
